# Privacy Consideration {#Privacy}
OP and RP MUST establish a legal basis before exchanging any personally identifiable information. It can be established upfront or in the course of the OpenID process. 

# Security Considerations {#Security}
      
The integrity and authenticity of the issued assertions MUST be ensured in order to prevent identity spoofing. The Claims source MUST therefore cryptographically sign all assertions. 

The confidentiality of all user data exchanged between the protocol parties MUST be ensured using suitable methods at transport or application layer.
