.# Abstract

This specification defines an extension of OpenID Connect that registers new JWT claims about End-Users. This extension defines new claims relating to the identity of a natural person that were originally defined within earlier drafts of OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance. The work and the preceding drafts are the work of the eKYC and Identity Assurance working group of the OpenID Foundation.

{mainmatter}

# Introduction {#Introduction}

This specification defines additional JWT claims about the natural person.  The claims defined MAY be used in various contexts including an id_token.

# Scope

This specification only defines claims to be maintained in the IANA "JSON Web Token Claims Registry" established by [@!RFC7519].  These claims SHOULD be used in any context that needs to describe these characteristics of the end-user in a JWT as per [@RFC7519].

# Claims {#claims}

## Additional Claims about End-Users {#userclaims}

This specification defines the following Claims for conveying End-User data in addition to the Claims defined in the OpenID Connect specification [@!OpenID] and the OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance specification [@!OpenID4IDA] and in any other context that a JWT (as per [@RFC7519]) may be used:

<!--
| Claim | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
|`place_of_birth`| JSON object | End-User’s place of birth. The value of this member is a JSON structure containing some or all of the following members:|
| | |`country`: String representing country in [@!ISO3166-1] Alpha-2  or [@!ISO3166-3] syntax.|
| | |`region`: String representing state, province, prefecture, or region component. This field might be required in some jurisdictions.|
| | |`locality`: String representing city or locality component.|
|`nationalities`| array | End-User’s nationalities using ICAO 3-letter codes [@!ICAO-Doc9303], 2-letter ICAO codes MAY be used in some circumstances for compatibility reasons.|
|`birth_family_name`| string | End-User’s family name(s) when they were born, or at least from the time they were a child. This term can be used by a person who changes the family name later in life for any reason. Note that in some cultures, people can have multiple family names or no family name; all can be present, with the names being separated by space characters.|
|`birth_given_name`| string | End-User’s given name(s) when they were born, or at least from the time they were a child. This term can be used by a person who changes the given name later in life for any reason.

|`birth_middle_name`| string | End-User’s middle name(s) when they were born, or at least from the time they were a child. This term can be used by a person who changes the middle name later in life for any reason. Note that in some cultures, people can have multiple middle names; all can be present, with the names being separated by space characters. Also note that in some cultures, middle names are not used.|
|`salutation`| string | End-User’s salutation|
|`title`| string | End-User’s title|
|`msisdn`| string | End-User’s mobile phone number formatted according to ITU-T recommendation [@!E.164]|
|`also_known_as`| string | Stage name, religious name or any other type of alias/pseudonym with which a person is known in a specific context besides their legal name.|
-->

| Claim | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|

| | |`region`: State, province, prefecture, または他の地域コンポーネントを表す文字列. 一部の管轄区域ではこのフィールドは必須かもしれない.|
| | |`locality`: city, または別の地域を表す文字列.|
|`nationalities`| array | ICAO 3-letter codes [@!ICAO-Doc9303] を用いてエンドユーザーの国籍を表す. 互換性の理由から，状況によっては 2-letter ICAO codes が使われるかもしれない (MAY).|

## Extended address Claim

<!-- This specification extends the `address` Claim as defined in [@!OpenID] by another sub field containing the country as ISO code. -->
この仕様は，[@!OpenID] で定義されている `address`クレームを，国を ISO コードとして含む別のサブフィールドによって拡張する．

<!-- `country_code`: OPTIONAL. country part of an address represented using an ISO 3-letter code [@!ISO3166-3], e.g., "USA" or "JPN". 2-letter ISO codes [@!ISO3166-1] MAY be used for compatibility reasons. `country_code` MAY be used as alternative to the existing `country` field. -->
`country_code`: OPTIONAL. ISO 3-letter code [@!ISO3166-3]  (例: "USA" や "JPN") を使用して表される住所の国部分．2-letter ISO codes [@!ISO3166-1] は，互換性の理由から使用されるかもしれない (NAY)．`country_code` は，既存の` country` フィールドの代わりに使用してもよい (MAY)．
